This algorithm assigns shorter codes to the most frequent characters, while comparatively uncommon characters receive larger codes, thus reducing file size optimally. This is accomplished by counting all the characters in a file, then constructing a Huffman Tree for assigning values to them. These codes are then written bit by bit to the output file. Features # Implements the classic Huffman coding algorithm. Supports compression and decompression of byte data. Leverages Go\u0026rsquo;s standard library packages for efficient file handling and data structures. Working # Take the input string \u0026ldquo;huffbit\u0026rdquo;:\nThis program makes the following Huffman tree:\nThe Codes for the characters are generated as:\nCharacter Code f 00 i 010 t 011 b 100 h 101 newline 110 u 111 After Writing the necessary headers, the encoded characters are written to the output file:\nAfter compression, the bytes needed get reduced from 8 in \u0026ldquo;huffbit\\n\u0026rdquo; to just 3 in the compressed file, making it a theoretical compression of 62%.\n","date":"13 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/huffbit/","section":"Projects","summary":"Implementation of Huffman Algorithm in Go","title":"Huffbit","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/express/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Express","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/javascript/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"JavaScript","type":"tags"},{"content":"A Public Messaging app with quirks, written in JavaScript.\nHosted at: https://okaychat.ary82.dev\nQuirks # Effortlessly acknowledge messages with a single keystroke.
